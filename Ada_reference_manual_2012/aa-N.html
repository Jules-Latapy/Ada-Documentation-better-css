<div class="paranum"><a name="p2">2</a></div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I9980"></A><B>Access type.</B> An access 
type has values that designate aliased objects. Access types correspond 
to &ldquo;pointer types&rdquo; or &ldquo;reference types&rdquo; in some 
other languages.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p3">3</a></div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I9981"></A><B>Aliased.</B> An aliased view 
of an object is one that can be designated by an access value. Objects 
allocated by allocators are aliased. Objects can also be explicitly declared 
as aliased with the reserved word <B>aliased</B>. The Access attribute 
can be used to create an access value designating an aliased object.</div>

<span class="insert2">An ancestor of a type is the type itself or, in 
the case of a type derived from other types, its parent type or one of

<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I9995"></A><B>Declaration.</B> A <I>declaration</I> 
is a language construct that associates a name with (a view of) an entity. 
<A NAME="I9996"></A><A NAME="I9997"></A>A declaration may appear explicitly 
in the program text (an <I>explicit</I> declaration), or may be supposed

<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 80%"><I>This paragraph was 
deleted.</I></SPAN><span class="delete2"><B>Definition.</B></span> <span class="delete2"><A NAME="I9998"></A>All 
declarations contain a <I>definition</I> for a <I>view</I> of an entity. 
A view consists of an identification of the entity (the entity <I>of</I> 
the view), plus view-specific characteristics that affect the use of 
the entity through that view (such as mode of access to an object, formal 
parameter names and defaults for a subprogram, or visibility to components 
of a type). In most cases, a declaration also contains the definition 
for the entity itself (a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-8-5.html#S0199">renaming_declaration</A></SPAN> 
is an example of a declaration that does not define a new entity, but 
instead defines a view of an existing entity (see <A HREF="AA-8-5.html">8.5</A>)).</span></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p13">13/2</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I9999"></A><B>Derived type.</B> A derived 
type is a type defined in terms of <span class="insert2">one or more 
other types given in a derived type definition. The first of those types</span><span class="delete2">&nbsp;another 
type, which</span> is the parent type of the derived type<span class="insert2">&nbsp;and any others are progenitor types</span>. Each class containing the 
parent type <span class="insert2">or a progenitor type&nbsp;</span>also contains 
the derived type. The derived type inherits properties such as components 
and primitive operations from the parent<span class="insert2">&nbsp;and progenitors</span>. 
A type together with the types derived from it (directly or indirectly) 
form a derivation class.</div>

<div class="paranum"><a name="p14">14</a></div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I10001"></A><B>Discrete type.</B> A discrete

<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I10007"></A><B>Exception.</B> An <I>exception</I> 
represents a kind of exceptional situation; an occurrence of such a situation 
(at run time) is called an <I>exception occurrence</I>. <A NAME="I10008"></A>To 
<I>raise</I> an exception is to abandon normal program execution so as 
to draw attention to the fact that the corresponding situation has arisen. 
<A NAME="I10009"></A>Performing some actions in response to the arising

<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I10014"></A><B>Generic unit.</B> A generic 
unit is a template for a (nongeneric) program unit; the template can 
be parameterized by objects, types, subprograms, and packages. An instance 
of a generic unit is created by a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-12-3.html#S0275">generic_instantiation</A></SPAN>. 
The rules of the language are enforced when a generic unit is compiled, 
using a generic contract model; additional checks are performed upon 
instantiation to verify the contract is met. That is, the declaration 
of a generic unit represents a contract between the body of the generic 
and instances of the generic. Generic units can be used to perform the 
role that macros sometimes play in other languages.</div>

types comprise the signed integer types and the modular types. A signed 
integer type has a base range that includes both positive and negative 
numbers, and has operations that may raise an exception when the result 
is outside the base range. A modular type has a base range whose lower 
bound is zero, and has operations with &ldquo;wraparound&rdquo; semantics. 
Modular types subsume what are called &ldquo;unsigned types&rdquo; in 
some other languages.</div>

<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I10018"></A><span class="insert2"><B>Interface 
type.</B></span> <span class="insert2">An interface type is a form of 
abstract tagged type which has no components or concrete operations except 
possibly null procedures. Interface types are used for composing other

Only an interface type can be used as a progenitor of another type.</span></div>

<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I10022"></A><B>Library unit.</B> A library 
unit is a separately compiled program unit, and is always a package, 
subprogram, or generic unit. Library units may have other (logically 
nested) library units as children, and may have other program units physically

<div class="paranum"><a name="p25">25</a></div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I10027"></A><B>Package.</B> Packages are 
program units that allow the specification of groups of logically related 
entities. Typically, a package contains the declaration of a type (often 
a private type or private extension) along with the declarations of primitive 
subprograms of the type, which can be called from outside the package, 
while their inner workings remain hidden from outside users.</div>

any kind of type, including an interface type.</span></div>

<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I10029"></A><B>Partition.</B> A <I>partition</I> 
is a part of a program. Each partition consists of a set of library units. 
Each partition may run in a separate address space, possibly on a separate 
computer. A program may contain just one partition. A distributed program 
typically contains multiple partitions, which can execute concurrently.</div>

<div class="paranum"><a name="p28">28</a></div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I10034"></A><B>Primitive operations.</B> 
The primitive operations of a type are the operations (such as subprograms) 
declared together with the type declaration. They are inherited by other 
types in the same class of types. For a tagged type, the primitive subprograms 
are dispatching subprograms, providing run-time polymorphism. A dispatching 
subprogram may be called with statically tagged operands, in which case 
the subprogram body invoked is determined at compile time. Alternatively, 
a dispatching subprogram may be called using a dispatching call, in which 
case the subprogram body invoked is determined at run time.</div>

unit</I> is either a package, a task unit, a protected unit, a protected 
entry, a generic unit, or an explicitly declared subprogram other than 
an enumeration literal. Certain kinds of program units can be separately 
compiled. Alternatively, they can appear physically nested within other 
program units.</div>

<span class="insert2">A subprogram is a section of a program that can

may qualify the effect of the subprogram through the passing of parameters. 
There are two forms of subprograms: functions, which return values, and 
procedures, which do not.</span></div>

a synchronized tagged type.</span></div>

<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I10053"></A><B>Tagged type.</B> The objects 
of a tagged type have a run-time type tag, which indicates the specific 
type with which the object was originally created. An operand of a class-wide 
tagged type can be used in a dispatching call; the tag indicates which 
subprogram body to invoke. Nondispatching calls, in which the subprogram 
body to invoke is determined at compile time, are also allowed. Tagged 
types may be extended with additional components.</div>
