However, consider when</span><span class="delete2">&nbsp;When</span> Set_Priority 
is called by a task T1 to set the priority of T2, if T2 is blocked, waiting 
on an entry call queued on a protected object, the entry queue needs 
to be reordered. Since T1 might have a priority that is higher than the 
ceiling of the protected object, T1 cannot, in general, do the reordering. 
One way to implement this is to wake T2 up and have T2 do the work. This 
is similar to the disentangling of queues that needs to happen when a 
high-priority task aborts a lower-priority task, which might have a call 
queued on a protected object with a low ceiling.<span class="insert2">&nbsp;We have an Implementation Permission in <A HREF="AA-D-4.html">D.4</A> 
to allow this implementation. We could have required an immediate priority 
change if on a ready queue during a protected action, but that would 
have required extra checks for ceiling violations to meet Bounded (Run-Time) 
Error requirements of <A HREF="AA-D-3.html">D.3</A> and potentially could 
cause a protected action to be abandoned in the middle (by raising Program_Error). 
That seems bad.</span>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p10.b">10.b</a></div>
<div class="Annotations" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>A

on a protected object with a low ceiling. This was changed because:&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p10.c">10.c</a></div>
<div class="SmallBulleted">The check was not feasible to implement on 
all systems, since priority changes might be deferred due to inter-processor 
communication overhead. The calling task would continue to execute without 
finding out whether the operation succeeded or not.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p10.d">10.d</a></div>
<div class="SmallBulleted">The run-time check would tend to cause intermittent 
system failures &mdash; how is the caller supposed to know whether the 
other task happens to have a queued call at any given time? Consider 
for example an interrupt that needs to trigger a priority change in some 
task. The interrupt handler could not safely call Set_Priority without 
knowing exactly what the other task is doing, or without severely restricting 
the ceilings used in the system. If the interrupt handler wants to hand 
the job off to a third task whose job is to call Set_Priority, this won't 
help, because one would normally want the third task to have high priority.

<span class="delete2"><A NAME="I8821"></A>If a task is blocked on a protected 
entry call, and the call is queued, it is a bounded error to raise its 
base priority above the ceiling priority of the corresponding protected 
object. When an entry call is cancelled, it is a bounded error if the 
priority of the calling task is higher than the ceiling priority of the 
corresponding protected object. <A NAME="I8822"></A>In either of these 
cases, either Program_Error is raised in the task that called the entry,

<div class="Annotations"><span class="delete2"><B>Ramification:&nbsp;</B>Note 
that the error is &ldquo;blamed&rdquo; on the task that did the entry 
call, not the task that called Set_Priority. This seems to make sense 
for the case of a task blocked on a call, since if the Set_Priority had 
happened a little bit sooner, before the task queued a call, the entry-calling 
task would get the error. In the other case, there is no reason not to 
raise the priority of a task that is executing in an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-9-7-4.html#S0244">abortable_part</A></SPAN>, 
so long as its priority is lowered before it gets to the end and needs 
to cancel the call. The priority might need to be lowered to allow it 
to remove the call from the entry queue, in order to avoid violating 
the ceiling. This seems relatively harmless, since there is an error, 
and the task is about to start raising an exception anyway.</span>&nbsp;</div>

Setting a task's base priority affects task dispatching. First, it can 
change the task's active priority. Second, under the <span class="insert2">FIFO_Within_Priorities</span><span class="delete2">&nbsp;standard 
task dispatching</span> policy it always causes the task to move to the 
tail of the ready queue corresponding to its active priority, even if 
the new base priority is unchanged.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p16">16</a></div>
<div class="Notes">30&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the priority queuing policy, setting 
a task's base priority has an effect on a queued entry call if the task 
is blocked waiting for the call. That is, setting the base priority of 
a task causes the priority of a queued entry call from that task to be 
updated and the call to be removed and then reinserted in the entry queue 
at the new priority (see <A HREF="AA-D-4.html">D.4</A>), unless the call 
originated from the <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-9-7-4.html#S0243">triggering_statement</A></SPAN> 
of an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-9-7-4.html#S0241">asynchronous_select</A></SPAN>.</div>

The rule for when Tasking_Error is raised for Set_Priority or Get_Priority 
is different from the rule for when Tasking_Error is raised on an entry 
call (see <A HREF="AA-9-5-3.html">9.5.3</A>). In particular, <span class="delete3">setting

<div class="Notes">33&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the priorities of a set of 
tasks can be performed by a series of calls to Set_Priority for each
