For tasks <span class="insert2">that are part or coextensions of a single

completing any initialization of the outermost object enclosing these

In particular, for tasks that are part or coextensions of the object 
</span>created by the evaluation of an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-4-8.html#S0143">allocator</A></SPAN>, 
the activations are initiated as the last step of evaluating the <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-4-8.html#S0143">allocator</A></SPAN>, 
<span class="delete2">after completing any initialization for the object

<span class="insert2">The intent is that &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; objects

created by an allocator. The &ldquo;whole&rdquo; object is initialized,

together. Each such &ldquo;whole&rdquo; object has its own task activation 
sequence, involving the activating task being suspended until all the

<div class="Annotations">We have replaced the term <I>suspended</I> with 
<I>blocked</I>, since we didn't want to consider a task blocked when 
it was simply competing for execution resources. &quot;Suspended&quot; 
is sometimes used more generally to refer to tasks that are not actually 
running on some processor, due to the lack of resources.</div>
