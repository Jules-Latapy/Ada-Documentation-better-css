    <H1>Foreword to this version of the Ada Reference Manual</H1>
    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.1/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Standard for the programming
    language Ada is ISO/IEC 8652:1995(E).</DIV>
    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.2/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ada Working Group ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 22/WG
        9 is tasked by ISO with the work item to interpret and maintain the International
        Standard and to produce Technical Corrigenda, as appropriate. The technical
        work on the International Standard is performed by the Ada Rapporteur
        Group (ARG) of WG 9. In September 2000, WG 9 approved and forwarded Technical
        Corrigendum 1 to SC 22 for ISO approval, which was granted in February
        2001. Technical Corrigendum 1 was published in June 2001.
    </DIV>
    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.3/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Technical Corrigendum lists the individual
        changes that need to be made to the text of the International Standard
        to correct errors, omissions or inconsistencies. The corrections specified
        in Technical Corrigendum 1 are part of the International Standard ISO/IEC
        8652:1995(E).
    </DIV>
    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.4/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ISO published Technical Corrigendum 1,
        it did not also publish a document that merges the Technical Corrigendum
        changes into the text of the International Standard. However, ISO rules
        require that the project editor for the Technical Corrigendum be able
    to produce such a document on demand.</DIV>
    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.5/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This version of the Ada Reference Manual is
        what the project editor would provide to ISO in response to such a request.
        It incorporates the changes specified in the Technical Corrigendum into
        the text of ISO/IEC 8652:1995(E). It should be understood that the publication
        of any ISO document involves changes in general format, boilerplate,
        headers, etc., as well as a review by professional editors that may introduce
        editorial changes to the text. This version of the Ada Reference Manual
        is therefore neither an official ISO document, nor a version guaranteed
        to be identical to an official ISO document, should ISO decide to reprint
        the International Standard incorporating an approved Technical Corrigendum.
        It is nevertheless a best effort to be as close as possible to the technical
        content of such an updated document. In the case of a conflict between
        this document and a Technical Corrigendum 1 approved by ISO (or between
        this document and the original 8652:1995 in the case of paragraphs not
        changed by Technical Corrigendum 1), the other documents contain the
    official text of the International Standard ISO/IEC 8652:1995(E).</DIV>
    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.6/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is very inconvenient to have the Reference
        Manual for Ada specified in two documents, this consolidated version
    of the Ada Reference Manual is made available to the public.</DIV>
    <DIV Class="Wide"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Using
    this version of the Ada Reference Manual</FONT></B></FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.7/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document has been revised with the corrections
        specified in Technical Corrigendum 1 (ISO/IEC 8652:1995/COR1:2000). In
    addition, a variety of editorial errors have been corrected. </DIV>
    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.8/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes to the original 8652:1995 can be identified
        by the version number /1 following the paragraph number. Paragraphs not
        so marked are unchanged by Technical Corrigendum 1 or editorial corrections.
        Paragraph numbers of unchanged paragraphs are the same as in the original
        Ada Reference Manual. In addition, some versions of this document include
        revision bars near the paragraph numbers. Where paragraphs are inserted,
        the paragraph numbers are of the form pp.nn, where pp is the number of
        the preceding paragraph, and nn is an insertion number. For instance,
        the first paragraph inserted after paragraph 8 is numbered 8.1, the second
        paragraph inserted is numbered 8.2, and so on. Deleted paragraphs are
        indicated by the text <I><FONT SIZE="-1">This paragraph was deleted.</FONT></I>
        Deleted paragraphs include empty paragraphs that were numbered in the
    original Ada Reference Manual. </DIV>

    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.9/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editor [R. Brukardt (USA)] would like
        to thank the many people whose hard work and assistance has made this
    revision possible.</DIV>
    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.10/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks go out to all of the members of the
        ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 9 Ada Rapporteur Group, whose work on creating
        and editing the wording corrections was critical to the entire process.
        Especially valuable contributions came from the chairman of the ARG,
        E. Ploedereder (Germany), who kept the process moving; J. Barnes (UK)
        and K. Ishihata (Japan), whose extremely detailed reviews kept the editor
        on his toes; G. Dismukes (USA), M. Kamrad (USA), P. Leroy (France), S.
        Michell (Canada), T. Taft (USA), J. Tokar (USA), and other members too
    numerous to mention.</DIV>
    <DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>0.11/1</FONT></DIV>
    <DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special thanks go to R. Duff (USA) for his
        explanations of the previous system of formatting of these documents
        during the tedious conversion to more modern formats. Special thanks
        also go to the convener of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 9, J. Moore (USA),
        without whose help and support the corrigendum and this consolidated
    reference manual would not have been possible. </DIV>
