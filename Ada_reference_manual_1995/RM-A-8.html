<H1> A.8 Sequential and Direct Files</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Static Semantics</H4>
<DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>1</FONT></DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I5496"></A><A NAME="I5497"></A>Two kinds
of access to external files are defined in this subclause: <I>sequential
access</I> and <I>direct access</I>. The corresponding file types and
the associated operations are provided by the generic packages Sequential_IO
and Direct_IO. A file object to be used for sequential access is called
a <I>sequential file</I>, and one  to be used for direct access is called
a <I>direct file</I>. Access to stream files is described in <A HREF="RM-A-12-1.html">A.12.1</A>.</DIV>
<DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>2</FONT></DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I5498"></A>For sequential access, the
file is viewed as a sequence of values that are transferred in the order
of their appearance (as produced by the program or by the external environment).
When the file is opened with mode In_File or Out_File, transfer starts
respectively from or to the beginning of the file. When the file is opened
with mode Append_File, transfer to the file starts after the last element
of the file. </DIV>
<DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>3</FONT></DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I5499"></A><A NAME="I5500"></A><A NAME="I5501"></A>For
direct access, the file is viewed as a set of elements occupying consecutive
positions in linear order; a value can be transferred to or from an element
of the file at any selected position. The position of an element is specified
by its <I>index</I>, which is a number, greater than zero, of the implementation-defined
integer type Count. The first element, if any, has index one; the index
of the last element, if any, is called the <I>current size</I>; the current
size is zero if there are no elements. The current size is a property
of the external file.</DIV>
<DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>4</FONT></DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I5502"></A>An open direct file has a
<I>current index</I>, which is the index that will be used by the next
read or write operation. When a direct file is opened, the current index
is set to one. The current index of a direct file is a property of a
file object, not of an external file. </DIV>
