<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada is a programming language designed to support
the construction of long-lived, highly reliable software systems. The
language includes facilities to define packages of related types, objects,
and operations. The packages may be parameterized and the types may be
extended to support the construction of libraries of reusable, adaptable
software components. The operations may be implemented as subprograms
using conventional sequential control structures, or as entries that
include synchronization of concurrent threads of control as part of their
invocation. The language treats modularity in the physical sense as well,
with a facility to support separate compilation.</DIV>
<DIV Class="Paranum"><FONT SIZE=-2>2</FONT></DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language includes a complete facility for
the support of real-time, concurrent programming. Errors can be signaled
as exceptions and handled explicitly. The language also covers systems
programming; this requires precise control over the representation of
data and access to system-dependent properties. Finally, a predefined
environment of standard packages is provided, including facilities for,
among others, input-output, string manipulation, numeric elementary functions,
and random number generation. </DIV>
