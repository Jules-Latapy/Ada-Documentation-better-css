	I have done it in java with a librairy<br/>
<br/>
	I put this project on my portfolio because I am pretty proud of it<br/>
	it help me find an work-study program because there topic have thing in common<br/>
	its complete (fine grained),<br/>
	the documentation is well rediged. <br/>
	For those who maintain and use the project it would be very easy<br/>

	Something doing code feels like being a wizard, <br/>
	i have push the concept further by making a programming language that do what other language do but in latin, <br/>
	I put this solo project on my portfolio because I am pretty proud of it <br/>
	the inside archtecture is very clean and modular, <br/>
	i have made the unit tests (which can be rare in programmer project), <br/>
	the document is not done :(, but I feel like there is no need <br/>
	and i made a coloring extension for a IDE call sublime text <br/>
